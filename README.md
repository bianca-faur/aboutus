# For the implementation of the slider I chose to use the Bootstrap Carousel Plugin
because it provides a straightforward way for cycling through elements.
I customised the bottom bullets so they look as per .psd and added two functions to control the sliding 
to the right element on clik on a circle and another one to toggle the active class of the circle.
